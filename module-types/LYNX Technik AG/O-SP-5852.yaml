comments: "To be able to model cabling in Netbox on a passive splitter we must model it using interfaces instead of front and rear ports.\r\n\r\nThis means\
  \ that interface type must be Other, and the connector type must be set in the description field.\r\n\r\nSplitting logic is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn {module}1.1\
  \ -> 50% split -> Out {module}.1.2\r\n                            -> Out {module}.1.2\r\n```"
